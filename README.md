# Wireshark Traffic Analysis: HTTP vs HTTPS in a Django Web Application

## Overview
This project uses Wireshark to analyze traffic generated by a Django web application. It compares unencrypted HTTP traffic to encrypted HTTPS traffic, demonstrating how SSL/TLS affects data visibility in network captures. The analysis showcases the importance of encryption in protecting sensitive information transmitted over web applications.

## 1. Capturing Web Application Traffic

To isolate traffic to and from the Django web server, I applied the following Wireshark display filter:

```Wireshark
ip.addr == 127.0.0.1 && tcp.port == 8000
```

I used the `ens33` interface, which corresponds to the virtual machine's network adapter where the Django app was hosted.

## 2. Identifying Unencrypted Data over HTTP

After launching the Django application via browser (HTTP), I captured network packets and found several types of plain-text data:

- HTML page content
- URLs and resource paths
- Form submissions with user input

This clearly shows how data transmitted over HTTP can be intercepted and read directly from packet payloads.

## 3. Inspecting Encrypted Traffic via HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

To secure the Django application, I configured it to run over HTTPS using the `django-sslserver` package. After setting it up and recapturing traffic in Wireshark:

- No readable HTML, form data, or resource paths were visible
- Payloads appeared encrypted, confirming SSL/TLS was active

This validated the protection of sensitive data via HTTPS and the encryption of application-layer traffic.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the critical role of SSL/TLS in securing web traffic. Wireshark clearly highlights the contrast between insecure (HTTP) and secure (HTTPS) communications, reinforcing why encrypted connections are essential for protecting user data.
